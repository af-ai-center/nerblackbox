A python package to smoothly fine-tune transformer-based models for Named Entity Recognition.

About
=====

`Transformer-based models <https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762>`_ like `BERT <https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805>`_ have had a `game-changing impact <https://paperswithcode.com/task/language-modelling>`_ on Natural Language Processing.

In order to utilize the `publicly accessible pretrained models <https://huggingface.co/transformers/pretrained_models.html>`_ for
`Named Entity Recognition <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition>`_,
one needs to retrain (or "fine-tune") them using labeled text.

**nerblackbox makes this easy.**
